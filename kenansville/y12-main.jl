# # Inside the Building
# # The NFPA 30 often limits the storage of flammable or combustible liquids to 120 gallons inside a building.
# # Approximate Space Needed: It's hard to define an exact square footage, but for a 120-gallon tank and its associated safety features (like spill containment and fire suppression), you might need a dedicated space that is at least 8x8 feet (64 sq ft) as a very rough estimate. This doesn't include space for aisles, accessibility, and other equipment.

# # Outside the Building
# # For outside, above-ground storage, NFPA and EPA often limit the aggregate capacity to 1,320 gallons.
# # Approximate Space Needed: Above-ground tanks with a total capacity of 1,320 gallons might require a dedicated space of at least 20x20 feet (400 sq ft) as a rough estimate. This should include space for secondary containment, safety barriers, and access for maintenance and refueling.
# # The Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) rule requires facility owners or operators with more than 1,320 gallons of above-ground oil storage capacity or 42,000 gallons of underground oil storage capacity to have a written plan that addresses how the facility will prevent oil spills to navigable waters and adjoining shorelines.
# # An owner/operator must prepare an SPCC Plan if the facility, due to its location could reasonable be expected to discharge oil into or upon a navigable water or adjoining shorelines, is a non-transportation related facility, and the facility exceeds a threshold capacity.  
# # For Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) applicability, only containers of 55 gallons or greater need to be considered toward a facility's oil storage capacity (67 FR 47042, 47066; July 17, 2002).  The 55-gallon minimum capacity also applies to oil-filled operating, manufacturing, or electrical equipment, such as transformers.  
# # Therefore, when determining if a facility meets the oil storage capacity threshold, an owner or operator must only consider oil-filled operating equipment that can contain 55 gallons or more of oil (40 CFR ยง112.1(d)(2)(ii)).

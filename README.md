# REopt Julia package
This package is currently under development, but it now has all of the capabilities of the REopt model used in the [REopt API](https://github.com/NREL/REopt_API). We expect to have the first stable release by Summer 2023.

For more information please see the documentation:

## Quick Start
Evaluating only `PV` and `Storage` requires a linear program solver. Adding a generator and/or multiple outages makes the problem mixed-integer linear, and thus requires a MILP solver. See https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/ for a list of solvers. The REopt package has been tested with `Xpress`, `Cbc`, `HiGHS` and `CPLEX`.

Note that not all solvers support indicator constraints and special order sets (such as HiGHS), and so not all REopt problems can be solved with solvers lacking these capabilities.

### Example
```
using Xpress
using JuMP
using REopt

m = Model(Xpress.Optimizer)
results = run_reopt(m, "path/to/scenario.json")
```
See the `test/scenarios` directory for examples of `scenario.json`.

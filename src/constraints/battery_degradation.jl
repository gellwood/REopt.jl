        When the battery degrades to 80% of purchased capacity it is replaced.
        Multiple replacements could be necessary within the analysis period.
        (The SOH is calculated for the analysis period, but not for multiple batteries.)
        So we construct a cost as a function of months that accounts for the number of replacements.
        (We use months instead of days to reduce the number of integer variables required).

        The replacment cost in a given month is:
        1. the maintenance_cost_per_kwh in (approximately) the 15th day of the month multiplied with
        2. the number of replacements required given the first month that the battery must be replaced.
        The number of months is analysis_years * 12.
        The first month that the battery is replaced is determined by d_0p8, which is the integer 
        number of days that the SOH is at least 80% of the purchased capacity.
        We define a binary for each month and only allow one month to be chosen.

    mutable struct StorageTypes

Used to store index sets used in decision variables and keys for accessing the various energy 
storage attributes.

Includes inner constructors for `BAUScenario`, `Scenario`, and `MPCScenario`. The constructor for the a
`Scenario` takes in a `Dict{String, AbstractStorage}`

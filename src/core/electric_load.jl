```

!!! note "Required inputs"
    Must provide either `loads_kw` or `path_to_csv` or [`doe_reference_name` and `city`] or `doe_reference_name` or [`blended_doe_reference_names` and `blended_doe_reference_percents`]. 

    When only `doe_reference_name` is provided the `Site.latitude` and `Site.longitude` are used to look up the ASHRAE climate zone, which determines the appropriate DoE Commercial Reference Building profile.

    When using the [`doe_reference_name` and `city`] option, choose `city` from one of the cities used to represent the ASHRAE climate zones:
    - Albuquerque
    - Atlanta
    - Baltimore
    - Boulder
    - Chicago
    - Duluth
    - Fairbanks
    - Helena
    - Houston
    - LosAngeles
    - Miami
    - Minneapolis
    - Phoenix
    - SanFrancisco
    - Seattle
    and `doe_reference_name` from:
    - FastFoodRest
    - FullServiceRest
    - Hospital
    - LargeHotel
    - LargeOffice
    - MediumOffice
    - MidriseApartment
    - Outpatient
    - PrimarySchool
    - RetailStore
    - SecondarySchool
    - SmallHotel
    - SmallOffice
    - StripMall
    - Supermarket
    - Warehouse
    - FlatLoad # constant load year-round
    - FlatLoad_24_5 # constant load all hours of the weekdays
    - FlatLoad_16_7 # two 8-hour shifts for all days of the year; 6-10 a.m.
    - FlatLoad_16_5 # two 8-hour shifts for the weekdays; 6-10 a.m.
    - FlatLoad_8_7 # one 8-hour shift for all days of the year; 9 a.m.-5 p.m.
    - FlatLoad_8_5 # one 8-hour shift for the weekdays; 9 a.m.-5 p.m.

    Each `city` and `doe_reference_name` combination has a default `annual_kwh`, or you can provide your
    own `annual_kwh` or `monthly_totals_kwh` and the reference profile will be scaled appropriately.


!!! note "Year" 
    The ElectricLoad `year` is used in ElectricTariff to align rate schedules with weekdays/weekends. If providing your own `loads_kw`, ensure the `year` matches the year of your data.
    If utilizing `doe_reference_name` or `blended_doe_reference_names`, the default year of 2017 is used because these load profiles start on a Sunday.

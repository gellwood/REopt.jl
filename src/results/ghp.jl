Adds the `GHP` results to the dictionary passed back from `run_reopt` using the solved model `m` and the `REoptInputs` for node `_n`.
Note: the node number is an empty string if evaluating a single `Site`.

GHP results:
- `ghp_option_chosen` Integer option # chosen by model, possible 0 for no GHP
- `ghpghx_chosen_outputs` Dict of all outputs from GhpGhx.jl results of the chosen GhpGhx system
- `size_heat_pump_ton` Total heat pump capacity [ton]
- `space_heating_thermal_load_reduction_with_ghp_mmbtu_per_hour`
- `cooling_thermal_load_reduction_with_ghp_ton`

`ElectricUtility` results keys:
- `annual_energy_supplied_kwh` Total energy supplied from the grid in an average year.
- `electric_to_load_series_kw` Vector of power drawn from the grid to serve load.
- `electric_to_storage_series_kw` Vector of power drawn from the grid to charge the battery.
- `annual_emissions_tonnes_CO2` # Total tons of CO2 emissions associated with the site's grid-purchased electricity in an average year. If include_exported_elec_emissions_in_total is False, this value only reflects grid purchaes. Otherwise, it accounts for emissions offset from any export to the grid.

If include_exported_elec_emissions_in_total is False, this value only reflects grid purchaes. Otherwise, it accounts for emissions offset from any export to the grid.

If include_exported_elec_emissions_in_total is False, this value only reflects grid purchaes. Otherwise, it accounts for emissions offset from any export to the grid.

!!! note "'Series' and 'Annual' energy and emissions outputs are average annual"
	REopt performs load balances using average annual production values for technologies that include degradation. 
	Therefore, all timeseries (`_series`) and `annual_` results should be interpretted as energy and emissions outputs averaged over the analysis period. 

!!! note "Emissions outputs" 
    By default, REopt uses marginal emissions rates for grid-purchased electricity. Marginal emissions rates are most appropriate for reporting a change in emissions (avoided or increased) rather than emissions totals.
    It is therefore recommended that emissions results from REopt (using default marginal emissions rates) be reported as the difference in emissions between the optimized and BAU case.
